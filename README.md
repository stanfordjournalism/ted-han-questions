## Questions for Ted


- Pepsi or coke?
- In your experience, what challenges or issues are particular to the field of journalism when it comes to doing programming and application development work? *DN*
- How eager/reluctant were journalists to upload sensitive documents (especially in preparation for a story that hadn't been published yet) to DocumentCloud? How did DocumentCloud adapt to meet the needs/worries of journalists? How did you convince them of the worth of publishing source documents? *DN*
- Why is uploading/publishing/disseminating documents such a challenge today? *DN*
- What makes DocumentCloud different than Scribd? *DN*
- Where do you see the most potential or yet-uncovered insights in terms of data/document mining as it pertains to journalism? *DN*
- If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? *DN*
- How did the design of DocumentCloud evolve to meet the needs of its users? *AN*
- How do you decide who can upload documents to DocumentCloud? As the scale of users and documents increases, what challenges do you face? *AN*
- How would DocumentCloud be different if it were not funded by the Knight Foundation? What markers of success do have for Documentcloud? *AN*
- DocumentCloud addresses some issues with the format in which information is given to journalists; especially through FIOA requests. Do you think the data organizational methods used by DocumentCloud could ever inspire data collection and storage policies in the government agencies themselves? *KA*
- Is there any potential (if this isn't a component already) of expanding the searchable files to include multimedia content (e.g. face recognition)? *KA*
- Besides the number of users, is there economic evidence of steps toward DocumentCloud's mission (such as has decreased the cost of high-return or high-impact story discovery for publications)? *KA*

How rare is it for journalists from different publications and ranks to come together and share open-source content online? Was there precedent for this anywhere? IS

How did you identify the need for a tool like DocumentCloud? Who specifically did you design DocumentCloud for and who have you seen make greatest use of the tool? CK

How are the documents on DocumentCloud collected and archived and how up to date are the documents available? What is the time range for the documents that you're collecting? CK

What are some of the shortcomings, if any, that you see in DocumentCloud now and how do you plan on addressing them in the future? What is the issue of top priority? CK

Since your background is in tech and startups, where did your interest in journalism come from and how did you end up working on DocumentCloud? CL

Have you seen resistance from any journalists to the idea of open-source content? CL

Besides document-sharing, what are other areas where you think tech people and journalists could work together more? CL

What do you see as the role of investigative journalism and IRE going forward? *EL*
